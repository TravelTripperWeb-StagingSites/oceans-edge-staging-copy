  "post_content": "<p><span>October is not for the faint of heart, especially if you are a Halloween lover like most of the population of St. Pete. Halloween is a big celebration in the area and we do not take this holiday lightly. We think it is so important, in fact, that we make sure to celebrate it all month long! We&rsquo;ve listed three of our favorite celebrations below, but be sure to check out the St. Pete Calendar <a href=\"https://www.visitstpeteclearwater.com/event-guide/halloween-events\">HERE</a> to get the full list of events this October.</span></p>\n<p>First and foremost is the St. Pete Zombie Food Booze Crawl. Get spooky with your fellow zombies and try all the latest craft beers and delicious bites on Friday, October 19th.</p>\n<p>Head over to Florida Botanical Gardens for an afternoon of pumpkin decorating, refreshments and spirited fun, you can even BYOP (Bring Your Own Pumpkin).</p>\n<p>Howl-O-Scream is a must when visiting the St. Pete area, this Busch Gardens theme has been the scariest thing around for decades!&nbsp;</p>"
