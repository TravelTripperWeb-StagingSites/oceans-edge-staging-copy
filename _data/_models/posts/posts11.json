Don&rsquo;t strike out on your last chance to catch the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/rays\">Tampa Bay Rays</a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>before baseball season is over. A</span>s summer comes to a close, so does America&rsquo;s favorite sport. The Tampa Bay Rays will only be playing for a few more weeks before the regular season wraps up. There is no better way to spend a summer night, than by eating hot dogs, drinking beer and cheering on Tampa&rsquo;s favorite team.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Tropicana Field is just a short trot away from the beautiful St. Pete beaches, after your fun day in the sun, grab your trusty baseball cap and mitt and head over to the field for the evening. The Tampa Bay Rays and Tropicana Field also have great deals on tickets for every single home game, making it an affordable way to treat the family to a sporty evening out. Just don&rsquo;t forget to &lsquo;root, root, root for the home team!&rsquo;</span></p>"
