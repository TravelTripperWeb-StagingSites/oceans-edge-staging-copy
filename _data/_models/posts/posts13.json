  "post_content": "<p><span>Turn your St. Pete vacation into a cultural art experience by taking a peek at The Dali Museum, located right on the South Yacht Basin. Salvador Dali was a Spanish artist who is well-known for the surrealist art he created. After his death in 1989, his artwork exploded and he became the most influential surrealist artist in the world. The Dali Museum in St. Pete houses the largest collection of original pieces created by Dali. The museum is open seven days a week &mdash; you can explore on your own or take a guided tour through the collections. If an audio tour is more up your alley, you can download the app before arriving and bring your own headphones to get the full Dali experience, while avoiding all the lines. Take a break from the beach and check out the intoxicating images created by Salvador Dali and relish in this famous artists work.&nbsp;</span></p>"
