After a stint in Paris, Hemingway made his way south, eventually arriving in Key West by way of Cuba. During his time in the Keys, Hemingway enjoyed one of the most prolific periods of his career, writing &ldquo;A Farewell to Arms,&rdquo; &ldquo;Death in the Afternoon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Green Hills of Africa.&rdquo; His legacy lives on at the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum. Visitors can explore the grounds of the famous author&rsquo;s former home for a glimpse into Hemingway&rsquo;s life in Key West.</h3>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hens &amp; Roosters Roam the Streets</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a stroll around the streets of Key West and you might notice some unusual inhabitants: chickens!
