While that remains one of the things we love most about this fun little town, if you look a little bit&nbsp;closer, you can find history all around. An amazing, yet often overlooked spot is the <a href=\"http://www.stpete.org/attractions/sunken_gardens/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunken Gardens</a>, located right here on the busy streets of St. Pete. This hidden gem holds some of the oldest most cherished flora in the entire region. This botanical garden is a great mix of nature and history all in one big, luscious block. Some may call it a quaint garden, but however you want to call it, it is definitely not a spot to be missed. Enjoy a little active meditation while you stroll the 100-year old tropical oasis in the heart of this buzzing city, and try to imagine yourself taking a step back in time to when St. Pete was a more simple city.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",
