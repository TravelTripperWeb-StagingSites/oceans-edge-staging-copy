The iconic <a href=\"https://www.clearwaterjazz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clearwater Jazz Holiday </a>event is just weeks away. This great even is centrally located right here in Southwest Florida. A great mix of beach weather, salty air, and banging tunes make this event one of the most highly anticipated all year long. Four days of great music begin on Thursday, October 17th, and the 2019 lineup and nothing short of amazing. You can expect to see features like Boyz II Men, Chicago, and Alison Krauss throughout the weekend. The gates open at a different time each afternoon, making Saturday the longest day of the event. Set yourself up at center stage and snap along to the smooth sounds of artists from all over the county. This swanky event is one that always brings large crowds and an energetically fun attitude. We can&rsquo;t wait to see you at this year's Jazz Holiday event!</span></p>"
