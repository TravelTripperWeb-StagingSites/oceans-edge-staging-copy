Filled with boutiques, fabulous restaurants, and entertaining street performances, South Beach&rsquo;s world-famous promenade has something for everyone. Here&rsquo;s your guide to Lincoln Road&rsquo;s storied history and multitude of options for places to grab a bite to eat and indulge in a little retail therapy.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The History of Lincoln Road</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lincoln Road was one of the first developed areas in all of South Beach. The social center became the heart of the island, featuring offices and premium retail destinations like Bonwit Teller, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cadillac, and Packard car dealerships. After a 1950s redesign, Lincoln Road (named after the 16th president) was elevated with gardens, fountains, and an amphitheater. As visitors continued to flock to the happening street, traffic eventually shut down and Lincoln Road became one of the nation&rsquo;s first pedestrian malls.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, Lincoln Road continues to evolve. The high-end stores have all but moved out to make room for independent shops, galleries, and eateries. You&rsquo;ll still find national retail stores among the 200 boutiques, but the artistic hub is now experiencing an indie resurgence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1561549829134\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" alt=\"friends-enjoy-ice-cream-outside-on-lincoln-road\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1561547889/yteivy9baoztzxy4xumm.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Where to Eat and Drink</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Locals are buzzing about the new Lincoln Eatery.

One spot you shouldn&rsquo;t miss during your trip to St. Pete Beach is <a href=\"https://www.floridastateparks.org/honeymoonisland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Honeymoon Island State Park</a>. This park is a great place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of more metropolitan areas like St. Pete and Tampa Bay. The quiet, white beaches are full of exotic birds, various fish, and even crabs&mdash; and it's all just a ferry stop away from the untouched Caladesi Island. Honeymoon Island and Caladesi Island make for an easy day trip right from the hotel to the shore. We suggest you pack a cooler of your own drinks and snacks and return just as the sun is going down. If island life is what you're craving, don't miss out on these unique Florida treasures!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",
