Grouper Week is exactly as it sounds, a seven-day stretch, full of delicious, white, flaky fish, prepared as many ways as possible. One of the most anticipated events of Grouper Week is the <a href=\"https://www.visitstpeteclearwater.com/event/grouper-food-truck-rally/7886\">Food Truck Rally</a> &mdash; where dozens of food trucks line-up to bring you their best version of a grouper dish. While you are chowing down, you can expect to sip on great booze and dance along to live music too. Grouper Week begins on July 21st and will be swimming all week until July 29th &mdash; don&rsquo;t miss your chance to enjoy summer in true Florida fashion!</span></p>"
