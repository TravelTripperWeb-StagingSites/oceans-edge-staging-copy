In Key West, the local uniform is styled with a casual beach chic aesthetic. Don&rsquo;t stress about what to pack on your Florida escape and make sure you&rsquo;re armed with all the essentials <em>without </em>overpacking.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swimwear</strong></h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that on any trip to the Keys, swimwear is a must. Those visiting our beach town often spend their days lounging by the water and soaking up the sunshine. From pristine pools to idyllic beaches, some of your favorite Key West memories will be made while wearing your swimsuit. No matter what time of year you visit, it&rsquo;s always swimsuit season.</p>\n<h3><strong>Bright Colors</strong></h3>\n<p>A far cry from the dark, monochrome styles of the North, Key West is a city splashed with color. From the vibrant blues of the surrounding ocean to the electric greens of the towering palm trees, the Keys are a place to stand out and be seen. Take inspiration from the artistic patterns and bright colors brought to life by <a href=\"https://www.lillypulitzer.com/\">Lily Pulitzer&rsquo;s</a> range of casual yet chic daywear.</p>\n<h3><strong>Keep it Light</strong></h3>\n<p>When packing your suitcase, keep in mind that the Keys stay warm year-round. Never dipping much below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, you can leave your winter coats at home. Stock your bags with beach-friendly wear suitable for a hot Florida day. Think: cotton tees, shorts, and linen pants and dresses.</p>\n<p>No matter what you wear during your stay in the Keys, don&rsquo;t forget to top off your beach fashions with the ultimate Florida accessory: sunscreen!
