The drive from Miami to Key West takes about four hours, spanning 100 miles and 42 bridges, so there are plenty of things to see and do on the way. Read on for our Florida Keys road trip itinerary, then pack your bags and head for the Sunshine State.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Starting Point: Homestead</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best place to start your journey down to the Keys is in Homestead, a city in Miami-Dade county. Homestead offers easy access to the U.S. Route 1, which will take you all the way to Key West. Before you hit the road, stop by Knaus Berry Farm (15980 SW 24 St.) and fuel up for the drive with their famous cinnamon rolls and fresh strawberries.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stop 1: Key Largo</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Largo is the gateway to the Keys. One of the bigger cities in the archipelago, Key Largo offers a variety of exciting things to do. Most notably, it&rsquo;s home to the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, the first underwater park in the country. Experience the diverse marine life from a clear-bottom boat, or by diving or snorkeling. Don&rsquo;t miss the haunting Christ of the Abyss statue, submerged in 25 feet of water since 1965.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stop 2: Islamorada</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islamorada is growing in popularity, but it still feels like your own personal hideaway.
