The West Indies Anti-Piracy Operations enabled merchant vessels to sail safely through the Straits of Florida. The remnants of this naval history can be seen throughout Key West. The U.S. Navy continues to utilize our strategic island as a naval base.<br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To plan your own historical Key West walking tour, get in touch with our team by calling (786) 862-6303 or by emailing </span><a href=\"mailto:concierge@oceansedgekeywest.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">concierge@oceansedgekeywest.com</span></a></p>"
