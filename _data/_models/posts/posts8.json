You can join a public tour or opt to do a private tour depending on your preferences. St. Pete has a plethora of delicious micro-breweries and this is one of the best ways to see them all. Load&nbsp;up the van with all your friends and family and let this be the way you ring in the holiday season together!</span></p>"
