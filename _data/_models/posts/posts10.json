There&rsquo;s something for everyone at all skill levels, from deep-sea fishing to flats fishing. Find all the equipment you need to spend a carefree day on the water with help from local tackle shops. Read on to get the inside scoop on local fishing with our Key West fishing guide.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Fishing in Key West</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Deep-Sea Fishing</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a day trip out to the open ocean and enjoy an exciting afternoon of deep-sea fishing. The deep blue waters of the Gulf Stream offer ideal conditions for deep-sea fishing. Out there, you&rsquo;ll be on larger fishing charters, all in search of big game fish. Some common fish you&rsquo;ll find out there include sailfish, blackfin tuna, king mackerel, and barracuda. Book your offshore fishing adventure with one of our trusted </span><a href=\"https://www.oceansedgekeywest.com/sportfishing?_icid=blog-oekw-fishing-may2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local partners</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Reef Fishing</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not quite as intensive as Key West deep-sea fishing, reef fishing &mdash; or light-tackle fishing &mdash; offers an unforgettable outdoor experience. Our local light tackle </span><a href=\"https://www.oceansedgekeywest.com/light-tackle-fishing?_icid=blog-oekw-fishing-may2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partners</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have 30-foot fishing charters and plenty of space to enjoy the day. Catch a variety of fish including grouper, kingfish, yellowtail snapper, and more.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Flats Fishing</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take to the clear blue shallows for a day of flats fishing. A more hands-on experience, flats fishing typically lasts a half day &mdash; about four hours &mdash; and is done on a smaller boat than deep-sea or reef fishing. The most commonly sought after fish on a flats fishing trip include tarpon, bonefish, and permit. </span><a href=\"https://www.oceansedgekeywest.com/flats-fishing?_icid=blog-oekw-fishing-may2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get in touch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with our team to plan your flats fishing excursion.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What to Bring</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.keywestbaitandtackle.com/we-rent-fishing-rods/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key West Bait and Tackle</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most well-known bait and tackle shop in town and it as all the equipment you&rsquo;ll need, available for purchase or rent. Rent light duty spinning rods and reels for just $25, plus $5 for each additional day. Here you can also purchase live bait and fishing tackle. If you don&rsquo;t want to book a fishing charter, you can fish from Mallory Square, the White Street Fishing Pier, and Fort Zachary Taylor Park.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Fisherman-Friendly Amenities</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Oceans Edge Key West, we make planning your fishing trip simple.
