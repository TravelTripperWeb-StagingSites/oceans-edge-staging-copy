Sand sculpting is coming to St. Pete Beach and it is even staying a week longer than normal. <a href=\"https://sugarsandfestival.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Pier 60 Sugar Sand Festival</a> will be in town on April 12th until April 28th. Artists from all over the world flock to the white sandy beaches of Florida to try their hand at creating something magnificent from sand and water. These aren&rsquo;t your average sand castles, some of these creations are pure magic. From dragons to life-size forts, your eyes will be amazed at what these artists can build with two everyday items. This festival has become one of the best sand sculpting festivals in all of Florida, with over 1000 sculptures to see alongside&nbsp;delicious food vendors, live music, and great company.
