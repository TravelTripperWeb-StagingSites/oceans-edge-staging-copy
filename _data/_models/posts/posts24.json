There&rsquo;s no better place to witness fireworks than on the waterfront of Vinoy Park and North Straub Park in St. Petersburg. Festivities kick off at 5 p.m. and fireworks overlooking the water start at 9 p.m. Be sure to arrive early to experience the food truck rally, bounce houses, face painting, and live music from Audio Star. Spend the morning relaxing at Postcard Inn, then gather your family and friends for an evening of merriment.</p>"
