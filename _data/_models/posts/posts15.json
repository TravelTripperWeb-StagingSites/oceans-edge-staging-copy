From April 13th&nbsp;through April 22nd, the famous white sand beaches along our coast will be in full sandcastle and sculpture action.&nbsp;This year, eleven sculptors will create sculptures and figures that represent the 2018 theme, Sea America: A Celebration of America&rsquo;s Treasures. More than 1,000 tons of sand will come to life on Pier 60 through a variety of works by sand artists, taking up 21,000-square-feet of display space. In addition to the artistic sand magic, guests will enjoy a dedicated children&rsquo;s play area, beach concerts, street performers, fireworks, sand-sculpting classes, speed sand demonstrations, and the highly-anticipated master sand sculpting competition. Expect a 10-day celebration with works by world-renowned sand artists and too many Instagram-worthy backdrops to count. Tickets to the festival are now <a href=\"https://www.visitstpeteclearwater.com/clearwater-beach-pier-60-sugar-sand-festival-events\">available.</a> You&rsquo;ll want to grab your spot on the sand for this annual celebration that the entire family&nbsp;is sure to enjoy.</p>"
