Hit the open road and head to Fort de Soto State Park. This uber dog-friendly beach allows dogs of all shapes and sizes to practice their best beach pose. It&rsquo;s the perfect place for dog-lovers to take in an afternoon of playing, wagging and wading. Remember to bring plenty of water, a towel, and shade for the hotter days. While your four-legged friend hydrates, quench your thirst at two of our top picks for mixing business with pleasure. Green Bench Brewing company serves up local brews and gives ample play space for dogs. Grab a flight and settle in. And, we love The Dog Bar, where dog park meets bar. After a long day of play, we&rsquo;ll be waiting for you back at the hotel with tails wagging.
